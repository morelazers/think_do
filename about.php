        	<h2>What is thinkdo?</h2>
            thinkdo is a place to share ideas, plain and simple. These ideas are then either 
            opened up to everybody else, or kept private by you. We operate on the basis 
            that other people will find and be passionate about your idea and as a result 
            want to help. We want to encourage and nurture <b>all kinds</b> of collaborative 
            projects; from inventing the next best bird feeder to mobilising the next generation 
            of social activists - we want it all to start here.<br><br>
            <h2>How do we make sure your idea reaches the right people?</h2>
            We use a system of interests, much like you would find on 
            <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a>; You simply fill out these 
            interests in your profile, and we find the best ideas that match them. We use 
            this system because let's face it, you're only going to take up a project 
            if you're interested in it. We have a pretty large list of interests already, 
            but you can add anything you like!<br><br>
            <h2>How does thinkdo differ from anything else?</h2>
            We don't know of another website out there dedicated to the same cause as us, 
            if there is, please feel free to let us know and we'll try to incorporate them! 
            We don't work for profit here, we work for you.
